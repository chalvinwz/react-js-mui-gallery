## Social Media Landing Page

This is a tutorial from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKZiXQWnlUw). We build a landing page for a social media where it lists various content. This was my first time exploring about [MUI](https://mui.com/) and this video help a lot. The version of the Library in the video is different and there are some breaking change.

### What I used to build this application:

- [React.js](https://beta.reactjs.org/) and [MUI](https://mui.com/) for the UI.
- [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/service/about/api/) for the API endpoint.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deploying the application.
